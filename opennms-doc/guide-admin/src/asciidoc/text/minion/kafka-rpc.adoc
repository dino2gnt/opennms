===  Tuning Kafka RPC on Minion

To avoid too many requests hogging the system at once, Kafka RPC Client on _Minion_ limits the maximum number of concurrent RPC requests.
Currently the maximum number of concurrent requests is set to 1,000 with a maximum wait time of 100ms.
With these settings, when concurrent requests reach 1000, Kafka RPC Client will allow only 10 extra requests per second.

Tune these settings as below:

[source, sh]
----
echo 'max.concurrent.calls=1000' >> "$MINION_HOME/etc/org.opennms.core.ipc.rpc.kafka.cfg"
----

[source, sh]
----
echo 'max.wait.time=100' >> "$MINION_HOME/etc/org.opennms.core.ipc.rpc.kafka.cfg"
----
